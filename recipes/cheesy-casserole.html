    <p>A five-ingredient hamburger rice casserole topped with melty cheese. My grandma used to make this and it was always a hit. She uses American cheese, but I make it with mozzarella. Very easy and yummy!</p>
    <p>My family loved it. I modified it by adding onions, bell pepper and a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce as well as using minute rice. I also went the mega easy route and made it a one skillet meal by melting the cheese on top of the dish on the stove.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with juice</li>
        <li>½ cup long grain white rice</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir until evenly browned.</li>
        <li>Drain off grease, and stir in the cream of mushroom soup, tomatoes, and uncooked rice.</li>
        <li>Cover, and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until rice is cooked, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler. When the rice is done cooking, transfer the contents of the skillet to a casserole dish. Cover with a layer of cheese.</li>
        <li>Broil until the cheese is melted and toasty. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
